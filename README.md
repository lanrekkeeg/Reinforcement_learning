 we apply reinforcement  learning on Hand to pick an obstacle placed in surrounding.Hand model is created in Gazebo and ROS is used to control this hand Model.
Three things are used in this reinforcement learning pronject.
  1. Reinforcement learning model
  2. Gazebo for stimulation
  3. ROS(robot operating system) for controlling the stimulated environment.
